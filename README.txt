Fwrap is a utility that takes fortran source code and provides cross-platform &
cross-compiler wrappers in C, Cython & Python.

It wraps the basic functionality you'd expect (functions, subroutines, scalar
and array arguments) and will eventually support all features of Fortran 90/95
(derived types, C/Cython/Python callbacks, wrap modules in Python classes).

It is currently under heavy construction.  The 0.1 release is scheduled for
April 2010.
